Simple App to help organize what kanji I have remaining to study for the JLPT N2 based on the 完全マスター kanji list.

10 Kanji are selected for a given set #. Then up to 30 kanji from past sets to review. The review kanji are selected based on a simple 'decay' to help mimic the [Ebbinghaus forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

The kanji numbers corrolate with whatever row I typed the kanji into on the original excel sheet I created, and not with the original 完全マスター kanji number.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
